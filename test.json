{"name":"#4544 Antimony","description":"POW NFT 4544. An Antimony atom, created with Proof of Work NFT mining.\n\nPOW NFT atoms are generated according to a scarcity model relative to the natural distribution of elements. The element, ionic charge and generative properties of the render are all determined by the token’s hash – an unpredictable result of the mining process.\n\nAtoms are rendered as a Live Model, this model is contained in the metadata and can be displayed in any browser. The video is a short capture of the live model. The metadata also contains a poster, which is a still rendering of the Atom optimised for print.\n\nPOW NFTs are the first ever mineable NFT, and are mined with an increasing level of difficulty using Proof of Work – a fundamental feature of blockchain first described in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin whitepaper. When a POW NFT is mined, a unique and increasingly rare ERC-721 token is created. The mining process prevents front-running and network congestion while maintaining security, and parallel mining-difficulty and price-demand-curves create natural, market-driven scarcity. \n","attributes":[{"display_type":"number","trait_type":"Generation","value":"12"},{"trait_type":"Element","value":"Antimony"},{"trait_type":"Period","value":"5"},{"trait_type":"Group","value":"15"},{"trait_type":"Category","value":"Metalloid"}],"poster":"https://www.pownftmetadata.com/p/4544","image":"https://www.pownftmetadata.com/v/4544","external_url":"https://www.pownft.com/collection/4544","background_color":"000000","liveModel":"https://www.pownftmetadata.com/l/4544.html","animation_url":"https://www.pownftmetadata.com/l/4544.html"}
